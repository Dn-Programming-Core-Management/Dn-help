        <span class="topic">NSF export</span><hr>

        <p class="text">
            NSF (Nintendo Sound Format, invented by Kevin Horton) is a type of file used to represent NES music, initially developed for storing ripped game music. That means NSF is not a native music format, but a small program that plays the music using the NES&#39;s CPU in a slightly similar hardware architecture.<br />
            Dn-FamiTracker compresses and compiles the module data and attaches a player program when exporing the NSF file.

        <p class="text">
            To export NSF files, select <code>Create NSF</code> from the File 
            menu to open the NSF export window.<br />
            The NSF file options contains some options related to the NSF file 
            format: the song information fields is the same as in the control 
            panel.<br />
            There is also a system type option: <code>NTSC</code>,
            <code>PAL</code> or <code>Dual</code>. Select <code>Dual</code> if 
            you want the NSF to be playable on both NTSC and PAL systems.<br />
            The <code>Add. data</code> checkbox indicates generating supporting 
            assembly code to be used with ASM or BIN export when compiling an 
            NSF file from source.</p>
        <p class="text">
            A few other formats beside NSF are also available:</p>

        <UL class="text">
            <LI>
                <b>NSF</b><br />
                Creates an NSF file.
                <br /><br /></LI>
            <LI>
                <b>NSFe</b><br />
                Creates an NSFe file with extra metadata for track labels, track
                times, and comments.
                <br /><br /></LI>
            <LI>
                <b>NSF2</b><br />
                Creates an NSF-compatible file containing NSFe metadata. This
                metadata is safely ignored in older NSF players.
                <br /><br /></LI>
            <LI>
                <b>NES</b><br />
                Encapsulates an NSF into an NROM NES file that can be played in
                emulators or with flash carts like PowerPaks and Everdrives.
                <br />
                Note that <b>only non-expansion audio, non-bankswitching modules
                whose total data is smaller than 32KB</b> are supported.
                <br /><br /></LI>
            <LI>
                <b>BIN</b><br />
                Stores only the music data and DPCM samples in separate files
                for use with NSF driver sources.
                <br /><br /></LI>
            <LI>
                <b>PRG</b><br />
                Creates a single 32 kB program ROM file, ready to be used with a
                NROM-compatible cart for playback on NES hardware.<br />
                Note that <b>only non-expansion audio, non-bankswitching modules
                whose total data is smaller than 32KB</b> are supported.
                <br /><br /></LI>
            <LI>
                <b>ASM</b><br />
                Stores the music data and samples in CA65 assembly format that
                can be used with driver sources.
                <br /></LI>
        </UL>

        <p class="text">
            As of Dn-FT version 0.5.0.2, the export plugin system has been disabled due to a potential security
            <a href="https://github.com/Dn-Programming-Core-Management/Dn-FamiTracker/issues/232">attack vector</a>.<br />
            In previous versions until vanilla 0.3.5, an export plugin system 
            was added that allows exporting to custom formats. New export 
            targets would appear in the drop-down menu when export plugin DLLs 
            were added.<br /></p>
