		<p class="text">
			The Sunsoft 5B is a chip manufactured by Yamaha, for Sunsoft. While used 
			interchangeably with the Sunsoft FME-7, and the Sunsoft 5A, the only game
			to utilize the audio was in the Famicom game Gimmick!. Due to Yamaha's 
			manufacturing, it is a clone of their own chip, the YM2149F, itself a 
			clone of the AY-3-8910. The chip has 3 channels of audio, capable of 
			Tone (square waves), 32 pitches of Noise, and a user configurable Envelope 
			generator. However, despite these features, Gimmick! only used the Tone 
			capabilities of the chip.

		<p class="text">
			Instruments on the Sunsoft 5B are fairly close to the 2A03. However the 
			biggest difference lies in the Noise/Mode macro, which replaces the Duty
			macro present on the 2A03. This macro allows one to toggle noise, tone, 
			and envelope on the channel, also allowing one to freely mix between the 
			three.
			<br>
			Another major change from the 2A03's instruments lies in the volume. 
			While the 2A03's design gives it linear volume, the Sunsoft 5B has 
			what is "exponential volume", which behaves differently than the 2A03's 
			linear volume.
			<!--Explain exponential volume better in the future, maybe?-->

		<p class="text">
			The Noise/Mode macro present in Dn-FT is relatively simple. There are three 
			bars, one for each "mode", which can be freely toggled. Above is a slider 
			allowing for the user to define what specific pitch they want, of the 32 
			available pitches. For reference, the Blue bar is for Tone, the Pink is for 
			Noise, and the Yellow bar is for Envelope.

		<p class="text">The Sunsoft 5B has a configurable envelope generator, able to 
			play back 16 preset envelope sets. The table below shows each envelope and 
			its functions.
