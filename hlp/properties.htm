    <p class="text">
        The module properties is used to manage songs, configure expansion chip,
        vibrato style, and pitch mode.</p>

    <p class="text">
        The song editor is used to manage multiple songs in a single module. The same
        instrument set will be used for all songs, and up to 64 songs are supported in a
        single file.</p>

    <p class="text">
        It is also possible to import module files as songs. Including
        instruments is optional: if you choose to then the new instruments and sequences will be
        added to the current project (it will not look for identical existing
        instruments). If you choose not then only pattern data will be included, this is
        used to combine multiple files where the same instrument set is
        used.</p>

    <p class="text">
        The expansion chip box is used to enable
        <a href="sound_overview.htm">expansion chips</a>
        for the module. Any combination of expansion chips may be enabled.</p>

    <p class="text">
        The channel count selector is only available for <a href="n163.htm">Namco 163</a>.</p>

    <p class="text">
        The Device mix offset box is used to adjust a module's
        <a href="sound_overview.htm">expansion chip</a>
        mixing level. They are correspondingly enabled by the current expansion chips used.</p>
    
    
    <p class="text">
        The Hardware-based mixing checkbox toggles between legacy expansion mixing, and
        hardware-based expansion mixing, whose measurements are based on the
        <a href="https://forums.nesdev.org/viewtopic.php?t=17741">audio mixing survey</a>.</p>

    <p class="text">
        The OPLL settings box is used to modify a module's current OPLL patch set when
        VRC7 expansion audio and the "Use external OPLL" checkbox is selected. This is intended
        for modules which use an external OPLL in place of VRC7 registers, such as TNS-HFC.</p>

    <p class="text">
        As of vanilla version 0.3.5, a new vibrato style is available. The new
        style is bending both up and down, as opposed to down only with the old style.
        The new style is default for new songs and the old style will be default for files created with earler versions of
        vanilla Famitracker. Here it's possible to change the style as you wish.</p>

    <p class="text">
        As of vanilla version 0.4.0, linear pitch was added but not available.
        It is implemented in 0CC version 0.3.14.2. Linear pitch treats all pitch effects
        on melodic channels uniformly by subdividing each semitone into 32 equal parts.</p>
