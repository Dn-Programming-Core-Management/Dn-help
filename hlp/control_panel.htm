    <p class="text">
        The first part is the frame editor (also known as order editor), located to
        the left. This may be adjusted to be next to the Pattern editor via the <a href="menu_view.htm">View menu</a> settings.</p>
    <p class="text">
        A frame is a set of patterns for all channels, where each
        channel is represented by a pattern number individual from all other channels. There
        are 128 available pattern slots for each channel, and the patterns aren't shared across
        the channels. Up to 128 frames can be used.<br /></p>

    <p class="text">
        To change pattern, press &quot;<b>+</b>&quot; or &quot;<b>-</b>&quot; buttons or &quot;<b>+</b>&quot; &amp;
        &quot;<b>-</b>&quot; keys in
        the pattern editor. If <b>"change all"</b> is checked, all channels will change
        instead of just the selected one. Use <b>Ctrl+Right</b> and <b>Ctrl+Left</b> to
        step through frames from the pattern editor. <b>Double click</b> or press <b>F3</b>
        to enable edit mode for the frame editor, where you can enter pattern values
        manually.</p>

	<p class="text">
		To expand the channel view, click on the right arrow on the top left corner.
		To minimize the channel view, click on the left arrow on the top left corner.</p>

    <p class="text">
        The frame editor also supports mouse selection and drag &amp; drop operations. Use <b>Shift+drag</b> to copy pattern numbers to new frames and <b>Ctrl+drag</b> to
        copy patterns to new frames.<br /></p>

    <img id="img" src="img/song_and_edit_settings.png" alt="Screenshot of song settings and edit settings."><br />

    <p class="text">
        Song settings is default play speed &amp; tempo, number
        of rows and frames in the song. Double-click any box to enter a value manually.</p>

    <p class="text">
        Click on the <b>Speed</b> button to toggle between Speed and Grooves.</p>

    <p class="text">
        Click on the <b>Tempo</b> button to toggle between Tempo and Fixed.
		Using Fixed mode tempo will force the tempo to sync with the engine tick rate <i>(2.5 * Engine tick speed)</i> and
		<a href="effect_list.htm#Speed"><b>Fxx</b></a> will now only set the speed.</p>

    <p class="text">
        Speed and tempo can also be changed by using pattern command <a href="effect_list.htm#Speed"><b>Fxx</b></a>.</p>

	<p class="text">
		The resulting BPM tempo (when Tempo is not fixed) is calculated by using the formula</p>

    <p class="text"><i>
        BPM = (6 * Tempo) / Speed</i></p>

    <p class="text">
        which means that the tempo box is correct at speed of 6.</p>

	<p class="text">
		The resulting BPM tempo (when Tempo is fixed) is calculated by using the formula</p>

    <p class="text"><i>
        BPM = (15 * Engine tick speed) / Speed</i></p>

	<p class="text">
		When Grooves are chosen instead of speed, the resulting BPM may vary depending on the
		current speed sequence of the groove.</p>

    <p class="text">
        The engine tick rate for the song is 60 or
        50 Hertz (when using default NTSC/PAL settings), and this is used to
        calculate the average tempo of the song. This means that some rows may play
        slightly longer or shorter than others,
        something that might be audible. To avoid this, leave the
        tempo setting at 150 (125 for PAL!) and use only the speed setting to change BPM
        to ensure that all rows get the same duration, or click on the <b>Tempo</b> button to
		force the tempo to sync with the engine tick rate.</p>
    <p class="text">
        Also be aware that the maximum supported BPM is 900 for NTSC and 750 for PAL
        (equal to speed 1 at tempo 150 / 125), going above that will not function
        properly!</p>

    <table class="noteFrame" cellpadding="5px">
        <tr>
            <td>
                <p class="text">
                    <b>Note:</b>
                    The speed & tempo split-point is currently set to 32, but files created in older versions of the tracker
                    will have this point set to 20. This was changed to give a access to a larger speed range since the speed
                    command sometimes is more useful than the tempo command.

                    It is possible to toggle this split-point with the command <i>Ctrl+Shift+S</i>
                    if you wish to change it in the current module.

        The step setting changes the step behaviour when moving the cursor in the
        pattern editor. Key repetition enables key repeat behaviour.</p>

        Song information &amp; instrument list</p>

    <img id="img" src="img/song_information_and_instrument_list.png" alt="Screenshot of song settings and edit settings."><br />

    <p class="text">
        Song information text fields are for <b>name</b>, <b>artist</b> and <b>copyright</b>. These strings are stored
        in NSFs (and also available in the NSF export dialog). The song
        list selects a song in multi-song files.
        The big list to the right is the instrument box, and
        the small toolbar is used to create,
        delete, open, save and edit settings for instrument and the text box is to name
        instruments.</p>
    <p class="text">
        The instrument list supports drag and drop operation for reordering instruments.</p>
