    <p>
        <b>Q:</b> <i>So... How do I get started?</i><br />
        <b>A:</b> The first thing to do would be to create an instrument. On the
        top-right corner of the screen you will see a large empty black box. Click the
        &quot;New Instrument&quot; button below that. Now double-click your new instrument, and
        start playing around with it (starting with volume obviously) until you get a
        sound that you&#39;re satisfied with. Then you can start laying down some notes, and
        away you go!
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Q:</b> <i>How do I add a sound chip like MMC5 or VRC6 to my module?</i><br />
        <b>A:</b> Simply open Module&gt;Module Properties. There you will find an Expansion
        Chip menu where you can select any one of the
        <a href="sound_overview.htm"
        title="Sound hardware">available sound chips</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Q:</b> <i>How do I create instruments for them? I can&#39;t find the option to
        create a <a class="mw-redirect"
            href="vrc6.htm" title="VRC6">VRC6</a>
        instrument!</i>
        <br />
        <b>A:</b> To create an instrument for a specific chip, the cursor should be
        focused on one of channels of the chip in question, because every chip has its
        own type of instrument and you cannot, for instance, use a 2A03 instrument on a
        VRC6 square channel.

        <b>Q:</b> <i>I can&#39;t find key for stopping note (dash symbol in the pattern).
        I&#39;ve checked &#39;Shortcuts&#39; in &#39;Configuration&#39;, and haven&#39;t found anything similar.</i><br />
        <b>A:</b> The key is definable, it is in &#39;Configuration&#39;, &#39;General&#39;,
        bottom-right corner (frame titled &#39;Keys&#39;). If you have problems with redefining
        the key, you may need to add the Standard English keyboard layout using your
        operating system&#39;s regional and language options.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Q:</b> <i>How do I write triplets?</i>
        <br />
        <b>A:</b> There are several valid ways to insert triplets in your module, but
        one of the most common ones is to use the <b><a class="mw-redirect"
            href="effect_list.htm#Delay" title="Gxx">Gxx</a></b>
        command. If your module&#39;s tempo and speed are set to 150 and 6, respectively,
        then you can use <b>G02</b> and <b>G04</b> on your triplet&#39;s second and third
        notes, and you will get perfect triplets. Bear in mind that if you are using a
        different tempo, different values will be required, so mess around with that
        until you get the sound you like.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Q:</b> <i>How to make patterns with different length?</i>
        <br />
        <b>A:</b> All the patterns have the same length (defined by the &quot;Rows&quot; field),
        however you can make one pattern shorter using effect <b><a class="mw-redirect"
            href="effect_list.htm#Skip" title="Dxx">Dxx</a></b>.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Q:</b> <i>How do I stop my song, as opposed to letting it loop all the time?</i><br />
        <b>A:</b> Use the <b><a class="mw-redirect"
            href="effect_list.htm#Halt" title="Cxx">Cxx</a></b>
        command at the very end of your module to stop it dead. <b>xx</b> does nothing;
        use zeros.
    </p>

    <h3><span class="mw-headline">Instruments</span></h3>
    <p>
        <b>Q:</b> <i>How to load instrument file (*.fti)?</i>
        <br />
        <b>A:</b> There are five buttons under the instruments list - New, Delete, Open,
        Save, Editor. Version 0.3.0 has some problems with instruments loading under
        Windows 7, they could not be saved or loaded from arbitrary folder.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Q:</b> <i>I&#39;ve made one instrument, and when I&#39;m trying to make another,
        first one changes as well.</i>
        <br />
        <b>A:</b> You should select new &#39;Sequence&#39; for new instrument. It could be done
        by clicking &#39;Select next empty slot&#39; button.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Q:</b> <i>I&#39;m having difficulty getting any sound out of my custom VRC7
        instruments. Help!</i>
        <br />
        <b>A:</b> The first thing to do if you want sound is to increase the attack on
        the carrier. Then you can mess around with the settings until you get something
        that you are pleased with.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Q:</b> <i>My VRC6 sawtooth wave sounds all wrong! What did I do?!</i>
        <br />
        <b>A:</b> Make sure you didn&#39;t accidentally set the duty cycle to 1 in the
        instrument settings or effect column. This is an intentional feature to distort
        the sawtooth wave.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Q:</b> <i>How do I get Sunsoft 5B envelopes to work?</i>
        <br />
        <b>A:</b> You first need to either set the chip to use Envelope in the Noise/Mode macro
        (the yellow bar) or put the Vxx command V04 into the effects column. Now place
        the Hxy command into the effects column (or another effect column if using Vxx). From
        here, there are two options: You can either control the envelope manually (using extra effects)
        or placing a note in any of the channels (using the autoenvelope feature). If you want to control
        the envelope manually, do H0y (replace "y" with desired envelope shape) and then use Ixx/Jxx
        effects to control the pitch. If you want to use the autoenvelope feature, use Hxy, (replacing "x" with
        the desired octave) and place a note with the envelope enabled.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Q:</b> <i>Is there a table that shows all the available envelope shapes?</i>
        <br />
        <b>A:</b> Yes! It can be seen in the <a href="sunsoft.htm">Sunsoft 5B</a> documentation.

        <span class="mw-headline">Troubleshooting</span></h3>
    <p>
        <b>Q:</b> <i>I have problem with Dn-FamiTracker under Windows Vista x64 or Windows
        7, the sound is stuttering.</i>
        <br />
        <b>A:</b> Try to update sound card drivers.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Q:</b> <i>I get sound alright, but it&#39;s constantly clicking.</i>
        <br />
        <b>A:</b> The buffer length is too short. Try adjusting it in the &quot;Sound&quot; tab in
        File&gt;Configuration.
    </p>
        <b>Q:</b> <i>WASAPI error: Could not open audio stream!</i> / <i>WASAPI error: Could not find sound device!</i>
        <br />
        <b>A:</b> Select an existing sound device in the &quot;Sound&quot; tab in File&gt;Configuration
        and refresh your sound configuration by pressing F12.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Q:</b> <i>I tried opening a module in Dn-FamiTracker, but it gives me an error message!</i>
        <br />
        <b>A:</b> The error message will tell you what went wrong with opening the file.<br />
        <ul>
            <li>
                &quot;FamiTracker module version too new, expected x or below&quot;<br />
                You are attempting to open a module from a newer version.
                Update to the latest stable release and try opening the file in it.</li>
            <li>
                &quot;FamiTracker module version too old, expected x or above&quot;<br />
                You are attempting to open a module from a version too old.</li>
            <li>
                &quot;Sequence index out of range: expected &lt;x&gt;, got &lt;y&gt;&quot;<br />
                The module is corrupted, and the file can't be read properly.</li>
        </ul>
        If the problem persists, report it to the
        <a href="https://github.com/Dn-Programming-Core-Management/Dn-FamiTracker/issues">
        Dn-Famitracker issue tracker</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Q:</b> <i>Why doesn't my 5B module sound correctly when exported?</i>
        <br>
        <b>A:</b> The answer often lies in the emulator running the exported NSF. Since
        the audio used in Gimmick! only uses the Tone part of the chip, the Noise and
        Envelope features are not required for the game to sound correct. Emulators like
        NSFPlay and Dn's internal emulation will be able to play back the file correctly,
        however.

    <p>
        <b>Q:</b> <i>Can raw PCM playback be implemented?</i>
        <br>
        <b>A:</b> Not at the moment. Playing samples through the 8-bit MMC5 DAC ($5011) or the
        7-bit DPCM DAC ($4011) requires constant attention from the emulated CPU core.
        This isn't practical with the current FamiTracker NSF driver or most drivers
        used in games. A new sound driver and hardware setup designed for PCM playback is required.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Q:</b> <i>Is Dn-FamiTracker available for Linux?</i>
        <br>
        <b>A:</b> Not natively, but you can run Dn-FamiTracker under Wine for the time being.
        A migration from MFC to Qt is planned in the distant future.
