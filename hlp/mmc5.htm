    <p class="text">
        The MMC5 contains two pulse wave channels that are identical to the
        internal pulse channels, except that the two hardware sweep units are missing.
        These channels also have a hardware volume envelope, accesible with
        <a href="effect_list.htm#Volume2A03EnvelopeToggle">Exx effects.</a><br /><br />

        The MMC5 has an 8-bit DAC for PCM playback, which is not supported in
        Famitracker. Playing samples through the MMC5 DAC ($5011) or the
        7-bit DPCM DAC ($4011) requires constant attention from the emulated CPU core.
        This isn't practical with the current FamiTracker NSF driver or most drivers
        used in games. A driver and hardware setup tailored for PCM playback is required.</p>

<p class="text"> A notable game using the MMC5 is Just Breed. A game which utilized the PCM channel is Shin 4-Nin Uchi Mahjong.</p>

    <p class="text">
        Due to the MMC5's pulse channels being a near clone of the 2A03 pulses, the instruments used by MMC5 are shared with 2A03.
