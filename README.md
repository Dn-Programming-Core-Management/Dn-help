# Dn-Famitracker Help

This repository hosts the source code for [Dn-Famitracker](https://github.com/Gumball2415/Dn-FamiTracker)'s help dialog. While the main program indeed has this contained within it's own source code, the main use of this repository is to provide finalized and finished versions of the Help File to all new releases of Dn-FamiTracker. 

As such it is best to consider this repository a "development" build of the help file, and may not represent the "final" builds included with Dn-FamiTracker releases.

## Goals

These goals are for what should be finished in the Help File for the next full Dn-FamiTracker release:

- [ ] Complete Sunsoft 5B documentation (almost done)
- [x] Add Command Line argument documentation
- [x] Clean up/correct documentation for other sound chips (2A03, MMC5, etc.)
- [ ] Update the FAQ to include newer Dn-Famitracker features
- [x] Update some screenshots and images to better reflect Dn-Famitracker's interface.
- [ ] Add "versions" to the Help file, to keep track of revisions made to the project files. (This will be done for the next Dn-FamiTracker release.)

#### Future roadmap

- Recode the entire help file from scratch
  - Will likely be done when the current help file is considered "complete".
  - Alternatively, recode what exists to help make future additions easier to implement.
- Host "release" versions on a website of some kind for viewing in a browser, much like the [archived CheeseCutter manual.](https://carol6502.neocities.org/c6_ccutter_guide.html)
  - This will likely be done when the manual is considered "complete".
- Possibly include (technical) documentations on FamiTracker's module and instrument formats, and also possibly the export formats.
